## About
The File Exchange Interface (FEI5) service offers secure file transaction, store, transport, and management services. FEI5 is the science data product management and distribution service used by most major space missions. The service offers a transaction-oriented approach in file management. That is, all concurrent updates to the same data product are prohibited. All uncommitted file transactions are automatically rolled back. The latest distribution, FEI5 software code name Komodo, is a complete redesign from its predecessors, which adopts the latest computing technologies and standards.
